<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PVC Waterstop Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centerbulb Type</li><li>Dumbbell Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>PVC waterstops are used in construction to prevent the passage of water through joints or cracks in concrete structures. There are two main types: Centerbulb type and Dumbbell type. Centerbulb type waterstops have a central bulb-shaped section that allows for increased movement while maintaining a watertight seal. Dumbbell type waterstops have a symmetrical shape resembling two bulbs connected by a thin waist, providing flexibility and preventing water infiltration. Both types ensure the durability and integrity of concrete structures by effectively controlling water flow and preventing leakage.</p></p>
