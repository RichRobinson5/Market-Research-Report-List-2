<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical flat panel X-ray detectors are devices used in X-ray imaging for detecting and capturing X-ray images. There are two types of detectors: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors use a scintillator material that emits light when X-rays hit it, which is then converted into an electrical signal. Direct conversion detectors, on the other hand, directly convert X-ray photons into electrical charges using a semiconductor material. Both types have advantages and disadvantages, including image quality, cost, and sensitivity, which are important factors to consider in the medical imaging industry.</p></p>
