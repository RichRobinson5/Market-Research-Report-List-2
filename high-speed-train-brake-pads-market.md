<p><strong>The High Speed Train Brake Pads Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OEM</li><li>Aftermarket</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The high-speed train brake pads market comprises two key segments: Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and Aftermarket. The OEM market involves the procurement and installation of brake pads directly from the manufacturer during the production of new high-speed trains. The Aftermarket market, on the other hand, involves the sale and replacement of brake pads after the initial purchase of the trains. Aftermarket brake pads can be obtained through authorized dealers or independent suppliers. Both segments cater to the demand for brake pads in the high-speed train industry, but differ in terms of timing and distribution channels.</p></p>
