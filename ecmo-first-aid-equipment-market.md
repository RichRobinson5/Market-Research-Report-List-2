<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ECMO First Aid Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>ECMO, which stands for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, is a life-saving technique used to support patients with severe respiratory failure or cardiac problems. The ECMO First Aid Equipment market includes two types: VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO and VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO. VA ECMO provides both respiratory and hemodynamic support by pumping blood from a vein to an artery. On the other hand, VV ECMO only provides respiratory support by oxygenating blood and returning it to the patient's venous system. Both types play a crucial role in helping patients in critical conditions.</p></p>
