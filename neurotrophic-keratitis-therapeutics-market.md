<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neurotrophic Keratitis Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drugs</li><li>Surgical Intervention</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Neurotrophic keratitis (NK) is a degenerative eye condition characterized by a lack of corneal sensation, leading to impaired corneal healing and potentially progressive damage. Therapeutics for NK can be categorized into two main types: drugs and surgical interventions. Drug-based treatments involve the use of medications like artificial tears, autologous serum eye drops, or neurotrophic factors to promote corneal healing and protect the eye. Surgical interventions, on the other hand, may include procedures such as corneal transplantation, amniotic membrane transplantation, or nerve grafting to restore corneal sensation and improve vision. Both approaches aim to manage and alleviate the effects of NK.</p></p>
