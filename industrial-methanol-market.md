<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Methanol Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>By-Product Sourced</li><li>Waste Sourced</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial methanol is sourced through two main types of markets: by-product sourced and waste sourced markets. By-product sourced methanol is obtained from the by-products and waste gases of various industrial processes, such as steel production and oil refining. It is a cost-effective method of methanol production as it utilizes otherwise wasted materials. On the other hand, waste sourced methanol is derived from organic waste materials, such as biomass and sewage, through a process known as gasification. This method provides an environmentally friendly solution while also reducing waste disposal issues.</p></p>
