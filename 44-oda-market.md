<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 4,4'-ODA Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recrystallization Type</li><li>Sublimation Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 4,4'-ODA market comprises two types: recrystallization type and sublimation type. In the recrystallization type, the compound is dissolved in a suitable solvent and then cooled slowly to allow the formation of high-purity crystals. This method is advantageous for large-scale production but requires additional purification steps. On the other hand, the sublimation type involves vaporizing the compound at high temperatures and then condensing it into solid form. This technique is preferred for smaller-scale production and offers excellent purity, eliminating the need for further purification steps.</p></p>
