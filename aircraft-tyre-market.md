<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Main Tyre</li><li>Front Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft tyre market comprises two main types: the main tyre and the front tyre. Main tyres are designed to support the majority of the aircraft's weight, handle the landing impact, and provide traction during taxiing. They are larger in size compared to front tyres and have a higher load-carrying capacity. On the other hand, front tyres are smaller and primarily serve the purpose of steering the aircraft during ground operations. These tyres are responsible for the aircraft's maneuverability and require high steering precision.</p></p>
