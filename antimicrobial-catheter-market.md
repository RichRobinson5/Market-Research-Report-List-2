<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antimicrobial Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Central Venous Catheters</li><li>Urinary Catheters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Antimicrobial catheters are medical devices that help prevent the growth of bacteria on the surface of the catheter, reducing the risk of infections. There are two types of antimicrobial catheters: central venous catheters and urinary catheters. Central venous catheters are inserted into large veins, typically in the neck, chest, or groin, to administer medication or fluids, or to monitor key indicators. Urinary catheters, on the other hand, are used to drain urine from the bladder. Both types of catheters are equipped with antimicrobial properties to limit the growth of bacteria and lower the chances of infections.</p></p>
