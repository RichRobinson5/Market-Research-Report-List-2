<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air-Cooled Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-Pole Air-Cooled Generators</li><li>4-Pole Air-Cooled Generators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air-cooled generators refer to power generation systems that utilize air as the cooling medium for their internal components. Two types of air-cooled generators exist: 2-pole and 4-pole. The 2-pole variant is designed with a higher speed and lower construction size, making it suitable for applications where space is limited. On the other hand, the 4-pole air-cooled generator operates at a lower speed, resulting in reduced noise and vibrations, making it more suitable for noise-sensitive environments. Both types offer reliable power generation solutions with efficient cooling mechanisms using air as the primary coolant.</p></p>
