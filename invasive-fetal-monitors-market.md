<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Invasive Fetal Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Portable</li><li>Non-portable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Invasive fetal monitors are medical devices used during pregnancy to monitor the health and well-being of the fetus. Portable fetal monitors are designed to be lightweight and easily transportable, allowing for continuous monitoring even when the mother is moving around. Non-portable monitors, on the other hand, are typically larger and remain stationary in the hospital setting. They are used when a more intensive or continuous monitoring is required, such as during labor or in high-risk pregnancies. Both types of monitors serve the purpose of monitoring the fetus for any potential complications or abnormalities.</p></p>
