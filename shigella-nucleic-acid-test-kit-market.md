<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shigella Nucleic Acid Test Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry PCR</li><li>Fluorescence PCR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Shigella nucleic acid test kit market includes two main types: dry PCR and fluorescence PCR. Dry PCR refers to a technique where the DNA amplification process occurs without the need for a liquid medium, which makes it easier to transport and store the kits. On the other hand, fluorescence PCR utilizes fluorescent dyes to detect the presence of Shigella DNA in samples, providing a more sensitive and accurate detection method. Both types of kits are used for diagnosing Shigella infections, but they utilize different technologies and offer distinct advantages.</p></p>
