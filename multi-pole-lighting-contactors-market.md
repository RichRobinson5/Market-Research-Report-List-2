<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi-Pole Lighting Contactors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanically Held</li><li>Electrically Held</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the multi-pole lighting contactors market, there are two types: mechanically held and electrically held. Mechanically held lighting contactors are operated using a mechanical latching mechanism, which means the contacts are physically held open or closed by a mechanical linkage. On the other hand, electrically held lighting contactors work using an electromagnetic coil to hold the contacts closed when power is applied. They rely on electrical current instead of a mechanical mechanism to control the opening and closing of the contacts.</p></p>
