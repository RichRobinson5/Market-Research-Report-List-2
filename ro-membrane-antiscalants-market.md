<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RO Membrane Antiscalants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acid Antiscalants</li><li>Alkaline Antiscalants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RO Membrane Antiscalants are chemical additives used in reverse osmosis (RO) water treatment systems to prevent scaling and fouling on the RO membranes. Acid Antiscalants are acidic compounds that dissolve scale-forming minerals, such as calcium and magnesium, preventing their crystallization and deposition on the membrane surface. Alkaline Antiscalants, on the other hand, contain alkaline compounds that inhibit scaling by changing the physical properties of the scaling minerals. Both types effectively protect the RO membranes, ensuring their longevity and optimal performance in water treatment applications.</p></p>
