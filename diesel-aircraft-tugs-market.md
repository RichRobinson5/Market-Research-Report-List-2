<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Aircraft Tugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Tractors</li><li>Towbarless Tractors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The diesel aircraft tugs market is divided into two main types: conventional tractors and towbarless tractors. Conventional tractors are equipped with a conventional towbar system that is attached to the aircraft's nose wheel. They require a separate towbar to connect with each aircraft and are commonly used for smaller aircraft. In contrast, towbarless tractors do not require a towbar as they use special lifting arms to lift the aircraft's nose wheel. This type of tug is more versatile and efficient, suitable for both small and large aircraft.</p></p>
