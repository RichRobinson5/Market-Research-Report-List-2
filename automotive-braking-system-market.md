<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc</li><li>Drum</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive braking system market consists of two main types: disc brakes and drum brakes. Disc brakes use a caliper and brake pads to clamp down on a rotor, generating friction that slows down the vehicle. This type of braking system is commonly found in high-performance and sports cars, as it provides better heat dissipation and improved stopping power. On the other hand, drum brakes use brake shoes that press against the inside of a drum to create friction and slow down the vehicle. This type of braking system is commonly used in smaller and less demanding vehicles, as it is more cost-effective but provides lower performance compared to disc brakes.</p></p>
