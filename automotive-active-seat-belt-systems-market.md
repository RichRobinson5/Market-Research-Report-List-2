<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Active Seat Belt Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Emergency Locking Retractor</li><li>Automatic Locking Retractor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive active seat belt systems refer to the technological advancements in seat belt mechanisms that enhance passenger safety. Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR) is a seat belt type that is designed to lock during sudden deceleration or impact, preventing excessive movement of the occupant. On the other hand, the Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR) system automatically locks the seat belt to secure the occupant once it is fully extended. Both these systems improve safety by restraining passengers during accidents and reducing the risk of injury.</p></p>
