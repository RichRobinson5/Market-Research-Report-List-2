<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant Polyester Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inherent FRP Staple Fiber</li><li>Treated FRP Staple Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame retardant polyester fiber (FRP) is divided into two main types: Inherent FRP staple fiber and Treated FRP staple fiber. </p><p>1. Inherent FRP staple fiber is made by incorporating flame retardant materials into the molecular structure of polyester during the manufacturing process. This type of fiber provides permanent flame resistance, as the flame retardant properties are inherent in the fiber itself. </p><p>2. Treated FRP staple fiber, on the other hand, involves applying flame retardant chemicals onto the surface of regular polyester fiber. This treatment enhances the fiber's flame retardant properties, but it may not be as long-lasting as the inherent FRP staple fiber. </p><p>Both types of FRP staple fiber play a significant role in various industries where fire safety is crucial.</p></p>
