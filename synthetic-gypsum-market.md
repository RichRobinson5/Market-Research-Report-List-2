<p><h1>Synthetic Gypsum Market Provides a Comprehensive Analysis Including a Macro Overview of the Market as well as Micro Details such as Market Size and Competitive Landscape</h1></p><p><strong>Synthetic Gypsum Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Synthetic gypsum is a byproduct of coal-fired power plants and industrial plants that utilize scrubbers to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide. It is produced by the desulfurization process, which removes sulfur from the flue gas before it is released into the atmosphere. The desulfurized gas is mixed with limestone to form synthetic gypsum, which can be used as a substitute for natural gypsum in a variety of applications such as wallboard, cement production, and agricultural use.</p><p>The global synthetic gypsum market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.7% during the forecast period. The increasing demand for synthetic gypsum in construction activities is a major factor driving market growth. Synthetic gypsum offers various advantages over natural gypsum, including improved workability, reduction in environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, the growing adoption of synthetic gypsum as a sustainable alternative to natural gypsum in the manufacturing sector is further fueling market growth.</p><p>The construction industry is the largest consumer of synthetic gypsum, with wallboard production being the major application. The increasing demand for eco-friendly and sustainable construction materials is driving the adoption of synthetic gypsum in the construction sector. Furthermore, the rising population and urbanization in developing countries are boosting construction activities, which, in turn, is propelling the growth of the synthetic gypsum market.</p><p>In terms of regional analysis, North America dominates the global synthetic gypsum market due to the presence of a large number of coal-fired power plants and strict environmental regulations. However, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period. The rapid industrialization and urbanization in emerging economies such as China and India are driving the demand for synthetic gypsum in this region.</p><p>Overall, the synthetic gypsum market is experiencing steady growth, driven by increasing construction activities, sustainability initiatives, and the adoption of stricter environmental regulations.</p></p>
