<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Wire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electro-galvanizing Wire</li><li>Hot-dip galvanized Wire</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Galvanized wire refers to a type of wire that has gone through a galvanizing process to prevent corrosion. There are two main types of the galvanized wire market: electro-galvanizing wire and hot-dip galvanized wire. Electro-galvanizing wire involves coating the wire with a thin layer of zinc through an electric current, resulting in a smooth and attractive finish suitable for indoor use. In contrast, hot-dip galvanized wire involves immersing the wire in molten zinc, creating a thicker coating ideal for outdoor applications that require increased durability and resistance to harsh conditions.</p></p>
