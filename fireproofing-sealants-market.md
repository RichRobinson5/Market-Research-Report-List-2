<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fireproofing Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fireproofing sealants are used to protect buildings from the spread of fire by creating a barrier that prevents the passage of flames, smoke, and toxic gases through joints and gaps in the structure. Elastometric type sealants are flexible and provide a durable, watertight seal, making them suitable for joints that experience movement. Intumescent type sealants, on the other hand, expand when exposed to heat, forming an insulating char layer to slow down the spread of fire. Both types of sealants play a crucial role in enhancing fire safety in buildings.</p></p>
