<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sheet Piling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Rolled</li><li>Cold Rolled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sheet piling is commonly used in construction projects to provide temporary or permanent support for excavations, or to prevent water from seeping into structures. The market for sheet piling can be divided into two main types: hot rolled and cold rolled. Hot rolled sheet piling is manufactured by heating steel to high temperatures, allowing it to be easily shaped and formed. Cold rolled sheet piling is produced at lower temperatures, resulting in a smoother surface finish. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications based on specific project requirements.</p></p>
