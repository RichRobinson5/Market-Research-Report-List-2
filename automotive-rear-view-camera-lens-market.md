<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Rear View Camera Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCD Cameras</li><li>CMOS Cameras</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two main types of rear view camera lenses in the automotive market: CCD cameras and CMOS cameras. CCD cameras use a Charge-Coupled Device sensor to convert light into electric signals. They are known for their high image quality and low noise levels. On the other hand, CMOS cameras use a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor sensor, which is more cost-effective and energy-efficient. Although CMOS cameras may have slightly lower image quality and higher noise levels compared to CCD cameras, they are widely used due to their lower price and improved technology over the years.</p></p>
